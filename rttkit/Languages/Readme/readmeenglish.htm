      <p align="left"><b>AMAZON</b>: Amazons are female warriors that decide to train themselves exclusively in the use of ranged weapons and spears.

      <p align="left"><b>GLADIATOR</b>: Fighting for entertainment, is the job of a gladiator. Sometimes a freed gladiator may decide to travel a world larger than a sandy arena, seeking adventure. Without a doubt, a gladiator is a good companion in a party. Because of the years spent in battle, gladiators develop an innate resistance to physical damage. But living in a world of ignorance and superstition, gladiators have a senseless fear of what they consider "strange", that is intelligence, wisdom and magic.<br>
      <br>
      ADVANTAGES:<br>
      - Strength and Constitution: +1<br>
      - Physical and Elemental Damage Resistance: +15%<br>

      <p align="left"><b>INVESTIGATOR</b>: Often, it's better ask questions before you kill. The investigator always tries to speak before a fight.

      <p align="left"><b>HALFLING THROWER</b>: Halfling warriors aren't famous for their hand to hand battles (or hand to legs, most likely), but for their reputation as skirmishers and missile specialists.

      - Requires 16 in dexterity<br>
      - Limited specialization in fighting styles and melee weapons</p>
      <p align="left"><b>SAMURAI</b>: A Samurai is the incarnation of honour in a warrior. Even if some of their choices may seem strange to a non-samurai, this caste of warriors is well-respected and revered.<br>

      <p align="left"><b>GIANT SLAYER</b>: There are very few gnomes who decide to leave their homes to dedicate their life to a great and noble cause: the destruction of giants!  Since antiquity gnomes and evil giants have despised one another. Giants have always held the advantage, except for the rare times when a brave giant slayer strode the land.<br>

      <p align="left"><b>ANTI-PALADIN</b>: An anti-paladin hates good and considers the ideals of goodness, fraternity and justice to be useless human inventions. True power belongs to the strongest and all others must subject themselves to him. The duty of the anti-paladin is to enter into the orders of real paladins to destroy them from within. He tries to convert the young knights (squires) into servants of evil. It is very important not to confuse the anti-paladin and the dark knight. The anti-paladin is a person with no innate abilities, but through study and perseverance they can be successful in inverting the typical innate abilities of the paladins. The anti-paladin's goals are to subvert the systems of justice that prevent his rise to power. The dark knight is a sort of half demon, half man with innate abilities who wants to destroy everything.&nbsp;<br>

The anti-paladin is a person with no innate abilities, but through study and perseverance they can be successful in inverting the typical innate abilities of the paladins. The anti-paladin's goals are to subvert the systems of justice that prevent his rise to power. The dark knight is a sort of half demon, half man with innate abilities who wants to destroy everything. In fact, the dark knight's only purpose seems to be to spread chaos and destruction through the world.<br>
      <br>

      <p align="left"><b>ELF PALADIN</b>: Now even elves are able to become paladins. If, for many people, a meeting with an human paladin is a rare occurrence, of which boast ca be made when they are old, a meeting with an elven paladin is a unique event. Few elves have the courage or temperament to embark on the road of a paladin and if only few attempt it, even fewer are brave enough to finally become true forces of peace and
      justice!<br>
      <br>

      - Less Detect Evil and Protection from Evil<br>
      - No Lay on Hands</p>
      <p align="left"><b>MESSIAH</b>: A messiah is a strong paladin equipped by his patron deity with great magic powers. He can be considered to be the messenger of the deity in the world. It's very important not to be confused: the body of the messiah has nothing of the divine nature. He is still condemned to die sooner or later, but until that moment he will be a mighty servant of Good.<br>
      <br>
      ADVANTAGES:<br>
      - Permanent Protection from Evil<br>

      <p align="left"><a href="#" name="ran"><font color="#0000FF">Ranger</font></a></p>
      <p align="left"><b>ARCANE RANGER</b>: Rangers spend a great part of their life in contact with nature. During this time they train themselves to become doughty warriors, in hand to hand and in distance combat. But not all Rangers do this. A few rangers can neglect physical exercises to concentrate themselves on spiritual ones. After many years of training these solitary men are able to communicate with nature, and can call the powers of nature to their aid using magic.<br>
      <br>

      - -40% hiding in shadows</p>
      <p align="left"><b>ELEMENTALIST</b>: An elementalist is a particular kind of ranger who has dedicated their life to fighting without protective devices. After many years of training, an elementalist's skin becomes as hard as stone! In practice, this means that an elementalist is protected by their natural armor and so is not encumbered by artificial armor. A side effect of this training is to increase the elementalist's resistance to every sort of climate.<br>
      <br>
      ADVANTAGES:<br>
      - Elemental Resistance: +3% at level 1-15<br>
      - Elemental Resistance: +2% at level 16-20<br>
      - Elemental Resistance: +1% at level 21-...<br>

      <p align="left"><b>TIME KEEPER</b>: It's said that time is an element, just like earth, air, fire or water and that, long ago, time was controlled by a druidic sect. Considering the existence of Time Keepers, this could be true!
